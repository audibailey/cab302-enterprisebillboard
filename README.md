This was a group assessment for CAB302, the task was to create a client-server-secondary client ecosystem for a billboard schceduling application. Unfortunately I have not had time to go through and clean up this assessment much but for the most part it should work. Majority of the documentation should be visible in the provided report PDF. My primary contribution to the project was backend development related (the server) and planning/management of the project.
