This was a group assessment for CAB302, the task was to create a client-server-secondary client ecosystem for a billboard scheduling application. Unfortunately I have not had time to go through and clean up this assessment much but for the most part it should work. You should just be able to test it all using maven builds that target respective applications (client, server, viewer) in the `src` directory. The default user and password is `admin` and `admin`. In an attempt to anonymise student numbers, I may have mangled the commits. My primary contribution to the project was backend development related (the server), planning/management of the project/repo/documentation and devops/unit testing (using bitbucket and bamboo at the time). My contributions (whether it was code or planning) is visible in the headings of the files on which my name (Perdana Bailey) is attributed to. A view of direct commits I attributed to are visible [here](https://github.com/audibailey/cab302-enterprisebillboard/commits?author=audibailey).
